This is a JPF extensions (see http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf) that 
allows the verification of LTL properties of Java code. 

LTL properties can include method names and signatures, and are specified using 
the @LTLSpec annotation in Java source files. For instance:
@LTLSpec("[](<> \"done(int,String)\")")
encodes the fact that method "done" is called infinitely often in the future
(notice that the method name is included in double quotes, which need to be
escaped).

To use the tool, simply add the @LTLSpec annotation to the top of the class you
want to verify and create a .jpf file similar to the following:

--- cut here ---
@using jpf-ltl
target=YOURCLASSHERE
finite=false

# You need this one to specify the appropriate listener
listener=gov.nasa.jpf.ltl.ddfs.InfiniteListener

# You need this one to specify the search strategy
search.class=gov.nasa.jpf.ltl.ddfs.DDFSearch

# And you need these jpf-core options, too
vm.storage.class=gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.FullStateSet
cg.enumerate_random=true
--- cut here ---
