The easiest way we found to use JPF was not to follow the standard install instructions.

We setup JPF by adding the core library and the aprop plugin to eclipse as Java projects that use the ant build system.
This way we could link our code base against them and eclipse would understand the annotations we were using.
We then ran it by creating a new eclipse build target that linked our project, jpf-core and jpf-aporp together. However the main class was gov.nasa.jpf.JPF rather than something from our project.
We also had to create a .jpf file that was passed as the only argument to the program.
The MoveOn.jpf file specifies what class to test and what parts of JPF to load to test it with.
