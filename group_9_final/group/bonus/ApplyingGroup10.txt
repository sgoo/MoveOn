The verification done in our system is based on what group 10 presented.
While we don't have explicit Pack and Unpack instructions, when the code is run with the verifier explicit Invariants are checked before and after each method call.
These allow us to ensure that the system is always in a consistent state.



While this isn't proper static analysis it was the only type of analysis we could get going with JPF.
